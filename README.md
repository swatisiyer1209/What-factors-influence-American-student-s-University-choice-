## Overview

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository for the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) dataset. This project aims to uncover the factors that significantly influence American students' decisions when applying and enrolling in particular universities. The analysis is conducted using RStudio, and this README provides information about the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from IPEDS, a comprehensive source for data on U.S. higher education institutions. The dataset encompasses a wide range of attributes related to universities and colleges, making it an excellent resource for understanding the dynamics of students' decisions.

## Analysis

The analysis is organized into several key steps, which are detailed in the `IPEDS.rmd`  file:

1. **Data Loading**: The IPEDS dataset is loaded into RStudio to begin the analysis process.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: An in-depth exploration of the dataset is performed to understand the distribution of relevant variables and relationships among them.
3. **Visualization**: Visualizations are created using popular R packages such as `ggplot2` to highlight trends, patterns, and insights discovered during the analysis.
